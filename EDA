#Variable Types

  Categorical Variables 

    Nominal: description (row ID) 
    Ordinal: inherent ranking (A, B, C assuming there is an order)
    Binary: two categories

  Quantitative Variables

    Continuous: measurement, age (can be any number) **should be stored as float
    Discrete: counts (money)

#Handle Duplicates

  Use the duplicated() method to locate full rows that are duplicated

#Missing Values

  You can delete, impute or request missing data.

#Statistics Intuition

  We are more confident when there is:
    Lower Variability (lower STD)
    A lower STD means that the data points are generally close to the mean overall
    Bigger Sample Size (more data)


#Confidence Level: 
  Quantifies how sure we are that the difference we see is a real and not due to random chance. 

  Quantifying Confidence (T-test for continuous variables such as revenue per user)

    Real Life example: we need to choose between two different checkout cart buttons for our A/B test. 

    95% Confidence: 95% chance (95 times out of 100 experiments) that when we conclude there IS a difference there really is. 
    OR there is a 5% chance that when we conclude there IS a difference but its just due to random chance (we just happened to get a few users in the store assigned to variant B who happened to spend more $$ than others. It had nothing to do with the type of add to cart button provided at checkout)
    99% Confidence: same logic however we need to a larger sample size or less variability to confirm there is a significant difference between checkout icons.

  Quantifying Confidence (Chi squared test for success rates/percentages)

    Real life example: conversion rates, click through rate (CTR). A pharmaceutical company is testing two advertising banners for their website. One has a 10% CTR and the other has an 11% CTR (11/100 users clicked). When measuring success is there a statistically significant difference between the two banners?
